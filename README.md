Introducing the Personalized Diet Plan Recommender, a web application developed using React, Node.js, Python, and Prolog. This innovative system leverages a knowledge base and rules to infer a user's dietary requirements and recommend a tailored meal plan. By considering inputs such as age, weight, height, and dietary preferences, the system generates personalized diet recommendations to promote a healthier lifestyle. The seamless integration of frontend and backend technologies enables a user-friendly experience, while Prolog's logic programming capabilities enhance the accuracy of the recommendations. The project's notable achievement lies in the successful integration of multiple technologies to create an intelligent diet plan recommendation system. Challenges were encountered in structuring the knowledge base and developing efficient inference rules. With the Personalized Diet Plan Recommender, users can embark on a journey towards improved nutrition and well-being.
